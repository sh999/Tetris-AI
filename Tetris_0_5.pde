/*Tetris version 0.5
Ver 0.5: Have better OOP design--Break down piecetype class
This version is intended to lead to the final tetris game
I have attempted to program tetris twice:
6/27: Fix disappearing piece.  Something to do with array passing thru function
One ends up with SaTris_no_trig:  Has good graphics but lacking in collision detection/tetris algorithm.  Has real tetris pieces
Two ends up with Tetris redesign with animation:  Has no graphics but has collision/tetris algorithm.  Doesn't incorporate real tetris pieces
Another important program is Tetris_2D_field_study
version 0.4: Can move around pieces and have collision detection.  Bug in that some pieces stay on field randomly.  Has bad
  OOP structure.  Version 0.5 will be more readable and have better OOP structure.
7/3: change color every piece. Done 7/7!
  create block class?
  7/7: Prevent disappearing permanent field
7/7: Check bottom, side, collisions
  7/7: Make booleans to know status of where piece can move.  Do this for left, right, bottom wall collisions. Done, with some bugs.
7/14: fix piece falling through bug, check checkallowablemoves().  FIxed 7/15.  Problem was when piece is on the edge
7/15: after fixing previous bug, another bug occurs where if piece touches wall, it can't move toward that edge even
  after it has been moved to middle
Bugs:
sometimes a piece falls through. Fixed 7/15
