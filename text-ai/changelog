changelog for tetris ai text experiment
List of things that were done (-), ideas (+), and tasks (*)

6/9/16
-Create namespace setup() to group functions that sets up field

6/8/16
-Made process_file() obsolete because input_field does the same thing
+Idea: Collect functions so far in a namespace

6/7/16
-Created function input_field() to take in field data file
+Idea: First, calculate "score" of field to measure ruggedness
	Eventually, AI will minimize this ruggedness

5/15/16
-Making process_file(), which takes in a text file of field

5/8/16
-In options.cpp, need to create function default(), which sets up field size of 10 x 20
	-Need to create separate Field class
-Created field class with own display
-Main program can now call either options to ask for user options or just run default_field() function 
-Parsing in options() still doesn't really work; it's still set as dummy values
	-Stopped using stringstream and just used cin >> row >> col
	-Need to add error handling for input
	-Optional: Add ability to run program with dimensions
		-e.g.: ./main 10 20

-Progress summary:
	-Created separate Field class
-Important tasks:
	-Expand on the class; make random fields to test AI with
-Misc:
	-Custom field size nice to have but not that important to implement

5/5/16
-Bare-bones design of main.cpp, options.cpp
-options.cpp asks user dimension of tetris field
-working on parsing string input to integers
	issues with istringstream not getting both values

Tasks:
*Allow for user to provide file and have program parse it
